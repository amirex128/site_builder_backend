# Application Layer

This directory contains the application layer components following Clean Architecture principles. The application layer orchestrates the flow of data to and from the domain entities, and coordinates high-level business operations.

## Structure

The application layer is organized according to the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern:

- `command` - Command handlers that modify state
- `query` - Query handlers that retrieve data
- `dto` - Data Transfer Objects for input/output
- `service` - Application services
- `event` - Domain event handlers

## Components

### Command Handlers

Command handlers are responsible for processing commands that modify the state of the system. They:
- Validate input
- Execute domain logic
- Persist changes through repositories
- Return minimal response data

### Query Handlers

Query handlers are responsible for retrieving data from the system. They:
- Accept query parameters
- Retrieve data from repositories
- Transform domain objects into DTOs
- Can leverage caching

### DTOs

Data Transfer Objects are simple data structures used for:
- Defining input/output contracts
- Transferring data between layers
- Decoupling domain models from external representations

### Application Services

Application services coordinate complex operations that:
- May span multiple aggregates
- Require orchestration of multiple domain operations
- Need transaction management

### Event Handlers

Event handlers process domain events and:
- Coordinate reactions to domain events
- Update projections for read models
- Handle cross-aggregate consistency
- Trigger external processes

## Design Principles

- **Use Cases**: Application services represent use cases of the system
- **Thin Layer**: Minimal business logic, mostly orchestration
- **Input/Output Ports**: Defines interfaces for external communication
- **CQRS Separation**: Clear separation of commands and queries
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on domain interfaces, not implementations

## Usage

The application layer depends on the domain layer but is independent of infrastructure and interface layers. It defines interfaces (ports) that are implemented by the infrastructure layer (adapters).
